Dear 

We are writing to discuss a crucial matter regarding our contract renewal with MainOne. As our business requirements have evolved, we kindly request an upgrade to our current network speed from 15 Mbps to a higher bandwidth.

This upgrade will greatly enhance our productivity, meet growing demands, and ensure optimal online performance. We value our partnership with MainOne and hope to negotiate terms that align with our mutual interests, including the possibility of implementing the upgrade at the existing contract price.

We appreciate the reliability and quality of service you have provided us, and we believe that this network upgrade will contribute to a stronger and more productive business relationship.

We kindly request a prompt response regarding the feasibility of upgrading our network speed as requested. We are open to discussing further details or providing additional information to support our case.

Thank you for your attention, and we eagerly await your positive response.

Sincerely,
